             ------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is purely educational. The reason why this program
exists, is just because I wanted to _really_ know what certificates 
technically are, how they are structured and how the data is encoded.

However, I'm sharing this as open source in case anybody else has the same
kind of detailed interesst in this area.
